# merkleeyes

A simple [ABCI](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/spec/abci/) application
serving a [merkle-tree key-value store](https://github.com/cosmos/iavl).

It provides read & CAS transactions, which allow us to test linearizability
using Jepsen. Also we're testing cosmos/iavl tree as a bonus.

_migrated from [tendermint/merkleeyes](https://github.com/tendermint/merkleeyes)._

## Use

Merkleeyes allows inserts and removes by key, and queries by key or index.
Inserts and removes happen through the `DeliverTx` message, while queries
happen through the `Query` message. `CheckTx` simply mirrors `DeliverTx`.

## Formatting

### Byte arrays

Byte-array `B` is serialized to `Encode(B)` as follows:

```
Len(B) := Big-Endian encoded length of B
Encode(B) = Len(Len(B)) | Len(B) | B
```

So if `B = "eric"`, then `Encode(B) = 0x010465726963`

### Transactions

There are four types of transaction, each associated with a type-byte and a list of arguments:

| Set                  | 0x01 | Key, Value                               |
| Remove               | 0x02 | Key                                      |
| Get                  | 0x03 | Key                                      |
| Compare and Set      | 0x04 | Key, Compare Value, Set Value            |
| Validator Set Change | 0x05 | PubKey, Power (uint64)                   |
| Validator Set Read   | 0x06 |                                          |
| Validator Set CAS    | 0x07 | Version (uint64), PubKey, Power (uint64) |

A transaction consists of a 12-byte random nonce, the type-byte, and the
encoded arguments.

For instance, to insert a key-value pair, you would submit a transaction that
looked like `NONCE | 01 | Encode(key) | Encode(value)`, where `|` denotes
concatenation.

Thus, a transaction inserting the key-value pair `(eric, clapton)` would look
like:

```
0xF4FCDC5BF26E227B66A1BA90010104657269630107636c6170746f6e
```

The first 12-bytes, `F4FCDC5BF26E227B66A1BA90`, are the nonce. The next byte,
`01`, is the transaction type. Following that are the encodings of `eric` and
`clapton`.


Here's a session from the [abci-cli](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/app-dev/abci-cli.html):

```
# SET ("eric", "clapton")
> deliver_tx 0xF4FCDC5BF26E227B66A1BA90010104657269630107636c6170746f6e

# GET ("eric")
> deliver_tx 0xB980403FF73E79A3A2D90A1E03010465726963
-> data: clapton
-> data.hex: 636C6170746F6E

# CAS ("eric", "clapton", "ericson")
> deliver_tx 0x18D892B6D62773E6AA8804CF040104657269630107636C6170746F6E010765726963736f6e

# GET ("eric")
> deliver_tx 0x4FB9DAB513493E602FF085C603010465726963
-> data: ericson
-> data.hex: 65726963736F6E

# COMMIT
> commit
-> data: ?????R?Ng?=HK}??7?
-> data.hex: BAEDE5CE8F9A52B64E67873D484B7DABF69537DA

# QUERY ("eric")
> query 0x65726963
-> height: 2
-> key: eric
-> key.hex: 65726963
-> value: ericson
-> value.hex: 65726963736F6E
```

## Build & Release

If you need to release a new version of the app, modify `Version` in app.go and run:

```
$ make release
```

This will create a .tar archive inside the `./build` directory, which
you will need to attach to the new release. It also updates the
`merkleeyes-url` in `../tendermint/src/jepsen/tendermint/cli.clj` to point to a new file.

## Poem

To the tune of Eric Clapton's "My Father's Eyes"

```
writing down, my checksum
waiting for the, data to come
no need to pray for integrity
thats cuz I use, a merkle tree

grab the root, with a quick hash run
if the hash works out,
it must have been done

theres no need, for trust to arise
thanks to the crypto
now that I can merkleyes

take that data, merklize
ye, I merklize ...

then the truth, begins to shine
the inverse of a hash, you will never find
and as I watch, the dataset grow
producing a proof, is never slow

Where do I find, the will to hash
How do I teach it?
It doesn't pay in cash
Bitcoin, here, I've realized
Thats what I need now,
cuz real currencies merklize
-EB
```
